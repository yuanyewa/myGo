Consider an array of non-negative integers. A second array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element. Given these two arrays, find which element is missing in the second array.
Here is an example input, the first array is shuffled and the number 5 is removed to construct the second array.
Input:
finder([],[3,7,2,1,4,6])
